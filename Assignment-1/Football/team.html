  <h2>About the Team</h2>
  <p><em>
      The India national football team represents India in international football and is controlled by the All India Football Federation. Under the global jurisdiction of FIFA and governed in Asia by the AFC, the team is also part of the South Asian
      Football Federation. The team, which was once considered one of the best teams in Asia, had its golden era during the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, under the coaching of Syed Abdul Rahim, India won gold during the 1951 and 1962
      Asian Games, while finishing fourth at the 1956 Summer Olympics.

      India has never participated in the FIFA World Cup, although the team did qualify by default for the 1950 World Cup after all other nations in their qualification group withdrew. However, India withdrew prior to the beginning of the tournament.
      The team has also appeared four times in the Asia's top football competition, the AFC Asian Cup. Their best result in the competition occurred in 1964 when the team finished as runners-up. India also participates in the SAFF Championship, the
      top regional football competition in South Asia. They have won the tournament seven times since it began in 1993.

      Despite not achieving the same results as in their golden era, the Indian team has seen a steady resurgence since the beginning of the 21st century. Besides the SAFF Championship triumphs, under the guidance of Bob Houghton, India won the
      restarted Nehru Cup in 2007 and 2009 and emerged victorious during the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup. The Challenge Cup victory allowed India to once again qualify for the Asian Cup, for the first time in 27 years.
